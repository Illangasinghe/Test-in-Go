# Developer Guidelines for Going Forward

As you move forward with developing and maintaining the **Test in Go** framework, it’s important to adhere to a set of best practices that ensure the framework remains scalable, maintainable, and aligned with business requirements. This guide will cover advanced practices for writing and maintaining Gherkin scenarios, collaborating effectively with stakeholders, and ensuring the quality and consistency of your test automation suite.

---

## 1. Writing and Structuring Gherkin Feature Files

### 1.1. Feature File Structure

Every feature file should continue following the **Feature → Scenario → Steps** structure to maintain clarity and readability.

Example:

```gherkin
Feature: Order processing through integration layer

  Scenario: Create product, add stock, and place order successfully
    Given a new product "Product A" is created using the SOAP API
    And stock of 10 units is added using the REST API
    When an order of 3 units is placed through the REST API
    Then the order should be processed successfully
    And the stock balance should be updated in the database
```

### 1.2. Naming and File Conventions

When structuring Gherkin feature files, adhere to the naming standards defined in the [Naming Conventions](naming_conventions.md) guide to ensure consistency across test cases.

- **Feature names** should succinctly describe the functionality under test.
- **Scenario names** should clearly describe the business logic and expected outcome.
  - **Good**: `Feature: Placing an Order`
  - **Bad**: `Feature: Test Order API`
  
File names should remain consistent, using **lowercase and underscores** (e.g., `order_processing.feature`).

### 1.3. Keeping Files and Features Focused

Keep feature files short and focused on a single functional area or business flow. Long, multi-scenario files become hard to maintain and debug.

---

## 2. Writing and Improving Scenarios

### 2.1. Scenario Granularity

Write each scenario to cover a **specific business flow** or **behavior**. Avoid cramming multiple actions or validations into one scenario.

- **Good**: `Scenario: Place an order when stock is available`
- **Bad**: `Scenario: Place order, update stock, and send notification`

### 2.2. Independent Scenarios

Ensure each scenario is **independent** of others. Scenarios should set their own preconditions to avoid dependencies on the execution order.

### 2.3. Scenario Tags

Tag scenarios for easy grouping and management in your CI/CD pipeline or for categorizing tests (e.g., regression, smoke, or integration).

Example:

```gherkin
@smoke @rest
Scenario: Validate the stock delivery API
  Given a product exists with ID "123"
  When I add stock for the product using the REST API
  Then the stock should be updated successfully
```

---

## 3. Writing Clear Gherkin Steps

### 3.1. Consistent Step Structure: Given, When, Then

Stick to the **Given-When-Then** structure to clearly define conditions, actions, and expected outcomes. This consistency allows stakeholders to easily understand test cases.

Example:

```gherkin
Given a new product is created with ID "123" using the SOAP API
When I add stock of 10 units using the REST API
Then the stock balance in the database should be 10
```

### 3.2. Business-Readable Steps

Avoid technical jargon in steps. Keep the language simple and clear so that **non-technical stakeholders** can understand the scenario.

- **Good**: `When I place an order for product "123" through the REST API`
- **Bad**: `When I POST a JSON payload to the /order endpoint`

### 3.3. Reusable and Parameterized Steps

Maximize the reusability of steps by parameterizing values like product IDs, quantities, or URLs. This allows steps to be used across multiple scenarios without hardcoding values.

```gherkin
Given a product with ID "<product_id>" exists
When I place an order for "<quantity>" units of product "<product_id>"
```

---

## 4. Testing Protocols and Validation

### 4.1. SOAP, REST, and Kafka Testing

Continue defining clear steps for different communication protocols.

- For **SOAP**: Define the payload and validate the response.
- For **REST**: Specify the HTTP method, endpoint, and payload, followed by response validation.
- For **Kafka**: Define both the messages sent to and received from Kafka topics.

Example for Kafka:

```gherkin
When I send a message to Kafka topic "order.created" with the following data
Then I should receive a message from Kafka topic "order.created" with ID "12345"
```

### 4.2. Database Validation

When working with your own databases, ensure proper validation by following the [Database Setup Guide](database_setup.md) to configure the database correctly.
Ensure scenarios validate the application’s interaction with the database. This includes checking that data is correctly created, updated, or deleted.

```gherkin
Then the "products" table should contain a product with ID "123"
```

## 5. Writing Step Definitions

### 5.1. Reusability and Maintainability

Ensure that step definitions are generic and can be reused across multiple scenarios. Avoid duplicating logic and keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

### 5.2. Parameterization in Step Definitions

Continue using **parameterized step definitions** to handle dynamic values. This improves flexibility and reduces the need to hardcode values in tests.

```java
@Given("^a product with ID \"([^\"]*)\" exists$")
public void createProduct(String productId) {
    // Step definition logic
}
```

### 5.3. Error Handling and Logging

Incorporate error handling and meaningful logging within the step definitions. This will aid in debugging by providing clear information about the root cause of any test failures.

---

## 6. Collaboration and Code Reviews

### 6.1. Code Reviews and Stakeholder Involvement

All Gherkin scenarios should undergo a **code review** with your development team and business stakeholders. This ensures that scenarios reflect real business requirements, maintain consistency, and meet quality standards.

### 6.2. Aligning with Business Requirements

Since BDD promotes collaboration, involve **business stakeholders** throughout the development of feature files to ensure scenarios match the expected behavior of the system. 


### 6.3. Involvement in **Test-in-Go**
Please follow steps as outlined in the [Contribution Guide](contribution.md).

---

## 7. Maintainability Best Practices

### 7.1. Avoid Duplication

Keep your steps modular and parameterized to prevent duplication across feature files. This improves maintainability as your test suite grows.

### 7.2. Scenario Coverage

Ensure that scenarios cover both **positive** and **negative paths**, as well as edge cases and boundary conditions. Include error handling tests, such as handling invalid inputs or system failures.

### 7.3. Consistent Updates

Regularly update your feature files and step definitions to reflect changes in business requirements, APIs, or system behavior. Outdated tests can lead to misleading results or missed bugs.

As your test suite evolves, refer to the [Project Architecture](project_architecture.md) to understand how each part of the framework interacts, ensuring you maintain the framework’s structure while adding new features.

---

## 8. Version Control and Collaboration

### 8.1. Meaningful Commit Messages

When committing updates or new test cases, use meaningful commit messages that describe the context of the changes. This helps the team understand the reason behind the updates.

- **Good**: `Added validation for stock balance in order placement`
- **Bad**: `Updated tests`

### 8.2. Continuous Integration and Testing

Leverage continuous integration (CI) tools to automatically run your test suite on each commit. Tag scenarios for smoke, regression, and integration tests to ensure test coverage across various environments.

---

## 9. Going Forward with BDD

As you continue to develop and maintain the **Test in Go** framework, it's essential to remember that BDD is a collaborative approach. Focus on creating tests that can be understood and discussed by all stakeholders, from developers to business teams. 

To understand the long-term goals and development focus, consult the [Development Priorities](priorities.md) document to ensure your tests align with the project’s broader objectives.

Make it a habit to regularly review and refine your test suite, ensuring it adapts to new requirements, remains maintainable, and helps drive the development of quality software.

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll ensure that the **Test in Go** framework remains effective, scalable, and collaborative—ensuring that your team can efficiently develop, test, and maintain complex systems with confidence.
