## Framework Priorities

### 1. Reliability and Foolproofing
The foundation of this framework is **reliability**, combined with **foolproofing** to minimize the risk of errors. The framework ensures consistent and trustworthy results, reducing false positives and negatives. To enhance reliability, the framework includes clear error messages, validation mechanisms, and robust safeguards to guide developers and testers toward correct usage. This reduces the chances of common mistakes and simplifies troubleshooting, helping teams quickly identify and resolve issues while ensuring confidence in the test results.

### 2. Developer and Business Stakeholder Friendly (BDD Support)
This framework prioritizes both **developer** and **business stakeholder** needs by embracing **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**. Tests are written in a readable format (Gherkin style) that aligns technical and business perspectives. This ensures better collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. By providing clear, reusable, and understandable scenarios, the framework allows everyone involved to contribute meaningfully.

### 3. CI/CD Compatibility
Built for seamless integration with **CI/CD pipelines**, this framework supports automated testing, parallel test execution, and real-time feedback within continuous integration and deployment workflows. This helps streamline deployment cycles, ensuring that tests fit naturally into modern DevOps practices.

### 4. Docker-Friendly and Local Machine Compatible
The framework is **Docker-friendly** while also running efficiently on **local machines** without the need for Docker. This ensures flexibility in various development and testing environments, whether containerized or local.

### 5. Reusability Across Projects
The framework promotes **reusability** across different projects, enabling teams to standardize their testing approach. This reduces the overhead of configuring a new test system for each project and accelerates the setup of consistent testing environments.

### 6. Intuitive and Flexible Design
An **intuitive and flexible design** makes it easy for developers to adopt the framework while also providing the flexibility required to handle complex scenarios. The framework minimizes complexity, allowing developers to focus on writing test cases rather than setup and configuration.

### 7. Futureproofing
The framework is built with **futureproofing** in mind, making it adaptable to new technologies, project requirements, and emerging testing needs. It ensures long-term scalability without requiring major rework as projects evolve.

### 8. Modularity and Extensibility
**Modularity and extensibility** allow developers to add new features or integrate external tools without affecting core functionality. The framework’s modular architecture supports customization, making it adaptable for specific project requirements.

### 9. Maintainability of Test Scenarios and Step Definitions
**Maintaining test scenarios and step definitions** is a key focus. The framework promotes reusable, parameterized steps and organized feature files. This minimizes duplication and makes test management more efficient as projects scale.

### 10. Consistency in Gherkin Test Writing
The framework enforces **consistency in writing Gherkin-style tests**, ensuring that BDD tests are written clearly, concisely, and in a business-readable format. This includes using consistent step definitions, structured scenario writing, and applying the Given-When-Then methodology. These practices make it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand test scenarios and ensure effective collaboration between technical and business teams.

### 11. Documentation
**Comprehensive documentation** is critical to the framework’s success. It includes clear setup instructions, examples, best practices for writing tests, and troubleshooting tips. This helps developers and testers easily adopt the framework and leverage its features effectively.

### 12. Test Report Clarity
**Clear and detailed test reports** are essential for debugging and tracking test performance. The framework generates reports that highlight essential information like pass/fail rates, error messages, and test coverage, ensuring quick insights into test results.

### 13. Easy Configuration and Setup
The framework is built for **easy configuration and setup**, allowing developers to get up and running quickly. Minimal initial setup and easy customization ensure a smooth onboarding experience.

### 14. Performance and Efficiency (Lightweight, Fast, and Memory Optimized)
The framework is optimized for **performance and efficiency**. It is lightweight, fast, and memory-efficient, ensuring that it can handle large-scale tests without performance degradation, particularly in CI environments.

### 15. Solid Boilerplate
A **solid boilerplate** ensures that developers can quickly start new projects with minimal setup time. The boilerplate provides a standardized foundation, reducing redundant configuration and allowing developers to focus on writing effective test cases.

### 16. Test Parallelization Support
The framework supports **parallel execution** of tests to improve efficiency and speed. This is particularly valuable for running large test suites, helping to minimize the impact of testing on build times.

### 17. Debugging Capabilities
Robust **debugging capabilities** are built into the framework, including detailed logs and error reports. These tools help developers quickly identify and fix issues in the testing process, improving overall efficiency.

### 18. Minimizing External Library Dependencies
**Minimizing external library dependencies** ensures that the framework remains stable, maintainable, and less vulnerable to third-party changes or updates. This keeps the testing process focused on core Go libraries and built-in functionalities.

### 19. Enhanced Capabilities Beyond Testing
This framework offers **enhanced capabilities beyond traditional testing**, such as the ability to create **mocks**, convert **raw JSONs into test cases**, and auto-generate test documentation. There is potential for **AI-driven capabilities**, including **LLM-based assistance** in the future, enabling automated test creation and intelligent insights.
